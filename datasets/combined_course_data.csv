This includes the entire interdisciplinary (ID) team(s), NEPA coordinators, NEPA document reviewers, and BLM decision makers. Preferred class size is 30 participants or less. Given the description and objectives noted above, for successful workshop completion the target audience must include the ID team tasked with completion of the issue-based EA. 

PREREQUISITES:

	* Required: NEPA Analysis Process for BLM (BLM-TC-1620-02)
	* Recommended: BLM NEPA Analysis for EAs course (BLM-1620-03)

 The BLM NEPA Analysis for EAs course (1620-03) encourages BLM staff to shift away from resource-based EAs and prepare issue-based EAs, but does not provide an in-depth approach for this process. This hands-on ID team approach to issue-based NEPA analysis provides BLM ID teams with a framework for preparing issue-based EAs by working through a specific EA in a workshop setting over a 40 hour period. The hands-on ID team approach involves a combination of instruction, discussion, writing, and review cycles where, for a specific action, the BLM ID team does the following:

	* identifies issues requiring detailed analysis, including articulating specific issue questions,
	* identifies issues which may be dismissed from detailed analysis along with rationale,
	* engages in impact analysis planning for issues to be analyzed in detail, and
	* drafts the analysis (affected environment and direct, indirect, and cumulative effects) for issues requiring detailed analysis.

 Using this hands-on approach, at the end of the 40 hour period, the BLM ID team has prepared (approximately 75% complete or more) an issue-based EA from identification and articulation of issues requiring detailed analysis, to planning the analysis, to implementing the analysis.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of the hands-on ID team approach to issue-based NEPA analysis is ultimately to prepare an issue-based EA (75% complete or more) in a workshop setting. Achieving this objective leads to BLM ID team members not only learning about the concepts and approaches being discussed but actually applying them in depth in a real EA.

This training is neither introductory nor comprehensive. The assumption is that all class participants are familiar with NEPA and its regulations. This is a narrowly focused, mid-level class that was designed for line managers who make the decisions on NEPA documents. It concentrates on the areas of a NEPA analysis where the manager has discretion: purpose and need, range of alternatives, depth of analysis. Sometimes public involvement is also included. We will briefly discuss CEQ regulations, guidance, and case law. Case law is included because it helps you understand the limits of your discretion and what constitutes ""good judgment"".

In addition, field managers and supervisors may find the introductory (Monday p.m.) and summary (Friday a.m.) materials especially valuable in work-force planning and in understanding the process by which PFC assessments are integrated into planning, management, implementation, and monitoring programs. 

The PFC for Professionals course uses a combination of small-team coaching, classroom instruction to introduce and study riparian concepts, and field instructions to teach advanced riparian field methods to prepare interdisciplinary teams to conduct PFC assessments. Proper Functioning Condition is an interdisciplinary assessment method that determines condition and trend in riparian areas. Findings from the PFC assessment are used by the interdisciplinary team:

	* to identify management issues, 

	* to identify specific management objectives, 

	* to prioritize management and restoration efforts, 

	* to design management actions to achieve PFC and desired conditions, 

	* to design appropriate monitoring programs including the establishment of properly located designated monitoring areas (DMAs) in riparian areas, and 

	* to implement an informed adaptive management strategy based on monitoring results. Training modules emphasize hands-on exercises and small-team coaching. 

Training modules include:

	* Instructions on performing pre-assessment tasks, such as: a. Sources of pertinent background information and data; b. Techniques for stratification and delineation of stream reaches; and c. Determination of potential natural conditions and identification of altered potential; and 

	* Advanced field methods to quantify or assess each of the 17 lotic (running water) and/or 20 lentic (still water) attributes and processes examined in the PFC assessment method; 

	* A study of various field indicators to determine trend in riparian conditions; 

	* Field practicum with coaching in small, interdisciplinary groups;

	* Instructions on preparing reports to summarize and communicate findings from the assessment; and 

	* Discussion of the integrated riparian management process, which outlines an efficient process for applying PFC assessment information into the development of management goals and objectives, management actions and monitoring program with adaptive management tools. During parts of the course, participants will be divided into smaller groups to learn the skill sets and field methods that are specific to each discipline (i.e., hydrology, vegetation ecology, and geomorphology/soil science).

COURSE NOTE:  Please refer to course flyer.

The course goal is to review and discuss approaches for securing, maintaining, managing and protecting water rights associated with public land management. Based on a review of case studies as well as specific instruction in California and federal water law, participants will review, discuss, and apply alternatives for securing water rights that will protect a diversity of water-dependent values.

OBJECTIVES:

To meet federal land management objectives, discuss and apply alternatives for securing and maintaining water rights including:

	* Identify when you need to file for a water right to support land management and project objectives.
	* If a water right is needed, identify which process is most appropriate to rely upon – filing under California water law procedures or reliance on a claim for a federal reserved right. Options include riparian right, pre-1914 right, post-1914 state appropriative right, exempt use or federal reserved water right.
	* Understand processes used to administer existing water rights including water use reporting, seeking enforcement against other users, avoiding forfeiture and reviewing public notices of water rights filed by other parties.
	* Identify the steps and processes necessary to address water rights in federal land management actions. These actions may include development and use of water (from    wells, springs, reservoirs, etc), administrative uses (fire-fighting, road maintenance, etc.), land exchanges, acquisitions/disposals, rights-of-way/special use permits and authorizing mineral/energy developments.
	* Identify the types of qualitative and quantitative inventory information of water sources necessary to secure, amend, maintain, and protect a water right.
	* Develop collaborative strategies for maintaining instream flow and flow-dependent habitat values.
	* Understand when and how to participate in processes established by the California Sustainable Groundwater Act to protect groundwater resources.

Participants in this intermediate-advanced level workshop will learn techniques to improve their efficiency in implementing the NEPA process. As NEPA practitioners are aware, a long-standing and frequent criticism of NEPA is that it, “takes too long, and costs too much.” Measures to address these concerns have included new administration and internal agency policies, and legislative proposals to expedite the NEPA process. The two main focuses of these efforts are implementing timelines to substantially shortening completion of NEPA reviews; and, setting maximum page limits for Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs). This workshop begins with a comprehensive review of NEPA basics, followed by techniques and best practices to improve agencies’ efficiency in completing the NEPA process. A range of best practices includes improving project management, scoping, decision making, defining proposal scope and scale, adaptive management, interagency coordination processes, and writing, will be discussed.  We will draw on information from CEQ Regulations and guidance, NEPA case law, and federal agency case studies. Agency-specific tailored workshops will concentrate on the agency’s NEPA policies and procedures and specific techniques to improve efficiencies tied to them.

OBJECTIVES:  

	* Understand the existing statutory and regulatory policies regarding page limits, time limits, and other relevant aspects of NEPA document preparation.
	* Apply approaches and techniques for improving the efficiency of the NEPA process.
	* Use lessons from recent case law to prepare NEPA documents in a more efficient manner.
	* Use the scoping process and improved interagency cooperation to improve the efficiency of NEPA reviews.
	* Use writing and document organization techniques to prepare more useful and compliant NEPA analyses and documents.

112,NPS-NRS3850,Exploring Facilitated Dialogue as a Civic Engagement Tool in Natural Resource Planning,"TARGET AUDIENCE:  Environmental compliance coordinators, planners, interpreters and educators, and resource management staff addressing critical or controversial issues
SUMMARY AND OBJECTIVES: During this class, participants will learn facilitated dialogue as a technique to conduct civic engagement activities. Facilitated dialogue is an intentional, structured process that invites people with varied experiences and often differing perspectives to engage in an open-ended conversation. It requires participants to move beyond surface assumptions that inform their beliefs. The set of questions creates an environment where participants can freely exchange perspectives in a respectful manner and lets participants draw their own conclusions.   Facilitated dialogue has potential for enhancing public involvement in planning and the decision-making processes. Some parks have been employing these techniques at ""pop up"" events where interpretive staff share traditional ""public meeting"" information and materials with park visitors. It also has potential as a technique to provide insight during a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process when a project's purpose, scope, and need are still being determined.  Through interactive and hands-on sessions, participants will: 

	* Understand the role and value of facilitated dialogue as a civic engagement tool

	* Explore the role of facilitated dialogue in natural resource planning

	* Explore the role of interpreters in using facilitated dialogue to engage with the public on planning topicss

	* Clarify assumptions and characteristics of effective dialogue

	* Explore and practice specific techniques to engage people in dialogue

	* Leave the class with new confidence in your facilitation skills, a new community of learning, and access to new resources and avenues of support.

SUMMARY AND OBJECTIVES: This primary goal of this course is to help SSA teams transition from analyzing the species to writing the report. We expect this course to benefit both Species Assessment Teams (SAT) and Field Office (FO) team leaders as well as team members, and we anticipate the benefits to be immediate and long term. As teams learn how to transition from the analytical to the report-writing phase, team leaders will learn how to help team members capitalize on their strengths to complete the report efficiently and how to build Fish and Wildlife Service capacity for future Species Status Assessments (SSAs) and report-writing work. The course’s collaborative writing material has implications both for and beyond SSAs, helping teams identify and set objectives for themselves as individuals and working groups as well as for species conservation broadly speaking. By introducing report-writing teams to the Prompt Book, the course also helps writers understand the objectives of the SSA report and briefly overviews some of the more important tools available to help teams accomplish these. Specifically, the course focuses on the most of these important of these objectives: creating a document with a clear logical chain that remains focused on species viability.

Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to:

	* Identify when the team is ready to move from analysis to writing
	* Implement the collaborative writing process and adopt the team roles that are best suited to the project and the personnel
	* Establish the SSA team’s report-writing objectives.
	* Identify team-writing pitfalls and have a strategy for resolving them
	* Identify the SSA report’s objectives and know how to access tools and resources to achieve them
	* Create a document with a clear logical chain that is focused on species viability

Datasets will be provided for all exercises and problem sets; attendees are not expected to bring datasets to the class. 

SUMMARY AND OBJECTIVES:   The 4-day course will provide instruction in the use of SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes), a hybrid statistical/mechanistic technique for modeling the occurrence and transport of contaminants in surface waters. SPARROW models are statistically calibrated using nonlinear estimation methods with stream water-quality monitoring data and geographic information on watershed characteristics. The mechanistic components of the model include explicit surface water flow paths, non-conservative transport processes, and mass-balance constraints. The separation of land and water components in the model provides estimates of the rates of pollutant delivery to streams from point and diffuse sources and the rates of transport and loss in streams and reservoirs. Model predictions are reported for individual stream reaches and watersheds, and include estimates of mass flux, yield, concentration, the source contributions to water, and the uncertainties associated with these predictions. SPARROW has been applied to nutrients, pesticides, suspended sediment, and fecal bacteria, and is applicable to other measures of water quality, stream biology, and streamflow. The class provides a theoretical and practical introduction to SPARROW modeling techniques, including ""hands-on"" opportunities to use the new SAS-based SPARROW software.

COURSE SUMMARY:  U.S. Geological Survey streamgages provide hydrologic information needed to define, use and manage the Nation’s water resources. The following presentation describes methods used to collect data at USGS gaging stations. These methods, along with the underlying philosophy of the streamgaging program have allowed the USGS to collect relevant streamflow data for over 100 years.  This presentation is based on WRIR 99-4120 by Michael Nolan and Jeff Phillips.  Some of the information in this presentation may be a bit outdated, but much of it is still relevant to collecting data at streamgages today.
